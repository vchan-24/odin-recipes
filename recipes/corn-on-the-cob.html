    <h1>Easy Microwave Corn on the Cob Recipe</h1>
    <p><img src="../images/corn-on-the-cob.jpg" alt="Image of corn on the cob" width="300"></p>
    <p>Microwave corn on the cob quickly and easily without crowding your grill or waiting for a whole pot of water to boil. This no-nonsense recipe for corn on the cob lets your microwave and a moist paper towel steam each ear of corn to perfection. I freeze the corn on the cob in plastic bags, and remove a single ear of frozen corn in the cold winter months to have the sweet taste of summer corn throughout the year!</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><b>1 ear fresh corn</b></li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Remove husk and silk from ear of corn.</li>
        <li>Wet a paper towel, then wring it out so it's still moist. Wrap the moist towel around the ear of corn and place it on a microwave-safe plate.</li>
        <li>Cook in the microwave until kernels are tender but still crisp when poked with a knife, 3 to 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Carefully remove and discard paper towel before serving.</li>
    </ol>
